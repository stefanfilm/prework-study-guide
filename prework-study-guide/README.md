- I am motivated to start my career as a software developer. I created this Prework Study Guide to create a platform to take notes as I progress in the bootcamp. The study guide solves the problem of having a dedicated space to keep my notes about the prework. I learned about the Git workflow, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I learned the fundamentals to become a successful software developer.

Each section of the Prework Study Guide contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If we open the DevTools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), we can see he JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. The information will be a resource as I continue to advance in the bootcamp.
